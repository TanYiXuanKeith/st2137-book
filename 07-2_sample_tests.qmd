## Introduction

In this topic, we introduce the routines for a common class of hypothesis tests:
the scenario of comparing the location parameter of two groups. This technique
is commonly used in A/B testing to assess if an intervention has resulted in a
significant difference between two groups.

Hypothesis tests are routinely abused in many ways by investigators. Such tests
typically require strong assumptions to hold, and can result in false positives
or negatives. As such, personally, I prefer to use confidence intervals to make
an assessment of the significance of a result. However, in this topic, we
introduce how the $p$-values can be obtained for these tests.

## Procedure for Significance Tests {#sec-sig-test-proc}

As a recap, here is the general approach for conducting a hypothesis test:

### Step 1: Assumptions

In this step, we make a note of the assumptions required for the test to be
valid. In some tests, this step is carried out at the end of the others, but it
is still essential to perform. Some tests are very sensitive to the assumptions
- this is the main reason that the class of robust statistics was invented.

### Step 2: State the hypotheses and significance level

The purpose of hypothesis testing is to make an inferential statement about the
population from which the data arose. This inferential statement is what we
refer to as the hypothesis regarding the population.

::: {.callout-note}
A hypothesis is a statement about population, usually claiming that a parameter
takes a particular numerical value or falls in a certain range of values.
:::

The hypotheses will be stated as a pair: The first hypothesis is the null
hypothesis $H_0$ and the second is the alternative hypothesis $H_1$. Both
statements will involve the **population parameter** (not the data summary) of
interest. For example, if we have a sample of observations from two groups $A$
and $B$, and we wish to assess if the mean of the populations is different, the
hypotheses would be

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: & \mu_A = \mu_B \\
H_1: & \mu_A \ne \mu_B 
\end{eqnarray*}

$H_0$ is usually a statement that indicates "no difference", and $H_1$ is
*usually* the complement of $H_0$. 

At this stage, it is also crucial to state the significance level of the test.
The significance level corresponds to the Type I error of the test - the
probability of rejecting $H_0$ when in fact it was true. This level is usually
denoted as $\alpha$, and is usually taken to be 5%, but there is no reason to
adopt this blindly. Think of the choice of 5% as corresponding to accepting an
error rate of 1 in 20 - that's how it was originally decided upon by Fisher.
Where possible, the significance level should be chosen to be appropriate for
the problem at hand.

::: {.callout-warning}
It is important to state the significance level at this stage, because if it is
chosen *after inspecting the data*, the test is no longer valid. This is because,
after knowing the $p$-value, one could always choose the significance level such 
that it yields the *desired* decision (reject or not).
:::

### Step 3: Compute the test statistic

The test statistic is usually a measure of how far the observed data deviates 
from the scenario defined by $H_0$. Usually, the larger it is, the more evidence 
we have against $H_0$.

The construction of a hypothesis test involves the derivation of the exact or
approximate distribution of the test statistic under $H_0$. Deviations from the 
assumption could render this distribution incorrect.

### Step 4: Compute the $p$-value

The $p$-value quantifies the chance of observing such a dataset under $H_0$. The 
distribution of the test statistic under $H_0$ is used to compute this value between 
0 and 1. A value closer to 0 indicates stronger evidence against $H_0$.

### Step 5: State your conclusion

This is the binary decision stage - either we reject $H_0$, or we do not reject
$H_0$. It is conventional to use this terminology (instead of "accepting $H_1$")
since our $p$-value is obtained with respect to $H_0$.

## Confidence Intervals

Confidence intervals are an alternative method of inference for population parameters.
Instead of yielding a binary reject/do-not-reject result, they return a confidence 
interval that contains the plausible values for the population parameter. Many 
confidence intervals are derived by inverting hypothesis tests, and almost all
confidence intervals are of the form 

$$
\text{Sample estimate}\; \pm \; \text{margin of error} 
$$

For instance, if we observe $x_1, \ldots, x_n$ from a Normal distribution, and
wish to estimate the mean of the distribution, the 95% confidence interval based
on the the $t$ distribution is

$$
\bar{x} \pm t_{0.025, n-1} \times \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
where 

* $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and 
* $t_{0.025, n-1}$ is the 0.025-quantile from the $t$ distribution with $n-1$ degrees
of freedom.

The formulas for many confidence intervals rely on asymptotic Normality of the 
estimator. However, this is an assumption that can be overcome with the technique 
of bootstrapping. We shall touch on this in the final topic of our course. 

Bootstrapping can also be used to sidestep the distributional assumptions in hypothesis
tests, but I still much prefer confidence intervals to tests because they yield an 
interval; they provide much more information than a binary outcome.

## Parametric Tests

Parametric tests are hypothesis tests that assume some form of distribution for
the sample (or population) to follow. An example of such a test is the $t$-test, which
assumes that the data originate from a Normal distribution. 

Conversely, nonparametric tests are hypothesis tests that do not assume any form
of distribution for the sample. It seems we should always use non-parametric
tests since distributional assumptions would not be violated, right?
Unfortunately, since nonparametric tests are so general, they do not have a high
discriminative ability - we say that they have low power. In other words, if a
dataset truly comes from a Normal distribution, using the $t$-test would be able
to detect smaller differences between the groups better than a non-parametric
test.

In this section, we cover parametric tests for comparing the difference in mean 
between **two** groups. 

### Independent Samples Test

In an independent samples $t$-test, observations in one group yield
*no information* about the observations in the other group. Independent samples can
arise in a few ways:

* In an experimental study, study units could be assigned randomly to different
treatments, thus forming the two groups.
* In an observational study, we could draw a random sample from the population, and
then record an explanatory categorical variable on each unit, such as the gender
or senior-citizen status.
* In an observational study, we could draw a random sample from a group (say
smokers), and then a random sample from another group (say non-smokers). This would
result in a situation where the independent 2-sample $t$-test is appropriate.

#### Formal Set-up

Formally speaking, this is how the independent 2-sample t-test works:

Suppose that $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_{n_1}$ are independent observations from group 1,
and $Y_1, \ldots Y_{n_2}$ are independent observations from group 2. It is assumed 
that 

\begin{eqnarray}
X_i &\sim& N(\mu_1,\, \sigma^2),\; i=1,\ldots,n_1 \\
Y_j &\sim& N(\mu_2,\, \sigma^2),\; j=1,\ldots,n_2
\end{eqnarray}

The null and alternative hypotheses would be 

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: & \mu_1 = \mu_2 \\
H_1: & \mu_1 \ne \mu_2 \\
\end{eqnarray*}

The test statistic for this test is:

$$
T_1 = \frac{(\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) - 0 }{s_p\sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2} }
$$
where 
$$
s^2_p = \frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1) s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 -2 }
$$

Under $H_0$, the test statistic $T_1 \sim t_{n_1 + n_2 -2}$. When we use a software
to apply the test above, it will typically also return a confidence interval,
computed as

$$
(\bar{X} - \bar{Y}) \pm t_{n_1 + n_2 -2, 1 - \alpha/2} \times s_p\sqrt{1/n_1 + 1/n_2}
$$

### Abalone Measurements

The dataset on abalone measurements from the [UCI machine learning
repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone) contains measurements
of physical characteristics, along with the gender status. We derive a sample of
50 measurements of male and female abalone records for use here. Our goal is 
to study if there is a significant difference between the viscera weight[^1] between
males and females. The derived dataset can be found on Canvas.

[^1]: Viscera is the gut weight after bleeding out the abalone (in grams).

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-abalone-1}
abl <- read.csv("data/abalone_sub.csv")
x <- abl$viscera[abl$gender == "M"]
y <- abl$viscera[abl$gender == "F"]

t.test(x, y)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-abalone-1}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy import stats
import statsmodels.api as sm

abl = pd.read_csv("data/abalone_sub.csv")
#abl.head()
#abalone_df.describe()

x = abl.viscera[abl.gender == "F"]
y = abl.viscera[abl.gender == "M"]

t_out = stats.ttest_ind(y, x)
ci_95 = t_out.confidence_interval()

print(f"""
* The p-value for the test is {t_out.pvalue:.3f}. 
* The actual value of the test statistic is {t_out.statistic:.3f}.
* The upper and lower limits of the CI are ({ci_95[0]:.3f}, {ci_95[1]:.3f}).
""")
```

#### SAS Output 

When we run the independent samples t-test on SAS, we should observe the following 
output @fig-sas-abalone-001.

::: {layout-ncol=1}

:::

:::

To assess the normality assumption, we make histograms and qq-plots.

::: {.callout-note}
Only the R code is shown here.
:::

```{r r-abalone-2}
#| layout: [[1], [1,1]]
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
#| fig-cap: 
#|   - "Histograms"
#|   - "QQ-plot for females"
#|   - "QQ-plot for males"

library(lattice)
histogram(~viscera | gender, data=abl, type="count")
qqnorm(y, main="Female Abalones");  qqline(y)
qqnorm(x, main="Male Abalones");  qqline(x)
```

We also need to assess if the variances are equal. While there are many
hypothesis tests specifically for assessing if variances are equal (e.g. Levene,
Bartlett), in our class, I advocate a simple rule of thumb. If the larger s.d is
more than twice the smaller one, than we should not use the equal variance form
of the test. This rule of thumb is widely used in practice (see @sec-web-ref).

::: {.panel-tabset}


#### R code 

```{r r-abalone-3}
aggregate(viscera ~ gender, data=abl, sd)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-abalone-3}
abl.groupby('gender').describe()
```
:::


We would conclude that there is no significant difference between the mean 
viscera weight of males and females.
:::

Apart from qq-plots, it is worthwhile to touch on additional methods that are 
used to assess how much a dataset deviates from Normality. 

### More on Assessing Normality

#### Skewness 

The Normal distribution is symmetric about it's mean. Hence if we observe asymmetry 
in our histogram, we might suspect deviation from Normality. To quantify this 
asymmetry, we use *skewness*. As we can see from @fig-skew, a histogram with a 
long tail on the right (left) is referred to as right-skewed (corr. left-skewed).

![Right/Non/Left-Skewed histograms](figs/summ_data-05.png){#fig-skew fig-align="center"}

One method of estimating the skewness of a distribution from data is:

$$
g_1 = \frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^3}{[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 ]^{3/2}}
$$
This is the method-of-moments estimator for the distribution skewness parameter. A value
close to 0 indicates low skewness (i.e. high symmetry). Positive values correspond to 
right-skew and negative values to left-skew.

#### Kurtosis 

Kurtosis measures the thickness of the tails of a distribution. Large kurtosis 
implies that the tails are "fatter" than those of a Normal, whil small, negative 
values indicate that the tails are "thinner" than those of a Normal.

The method of moments estimator is 

$$
g_2 = \frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^4}{[\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \bar{x})^2 ]^2} - 3
$$

#### Hypothesis tests for Normality

The Shapiro-Wilk test and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test are formal hypothesis
tests with the following hypotheses:

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: & \text{ Data follows a Normal distribution} \\
H_1: & \text{ Data does not follow a Normal distribution} 
\end{eqnarray*}

You can read more about them in the references, but take note that applying
multiple tests leads to a higher Type I error. Moreover, a large small sample
size will almost always reject $H_0$ because small deviations are being classed
as significant. I advocate a more graphical approach in assessing Normality,
especially since the solution to Non-normality (the bootstrap) is readily
accessible today.

### Abalone Measurements

Let us apply the above computations to the abalone measurements.

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

```{r r-abalone-4}
#| collapse: true
library(DescTools)
aggregate(viscera ~ gender, data=abl, Skew, method=1)

aggregate(viscera ~ gender, data=abl, Kurt, method=1)

# Shapiro-Wilk Test only for males:
shapiro.test(x)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-abalone-4}
#| collapse: true
abl.groupby("gender").skew()

for i,df in abl.groupby('gender'):
    print(f"{df.gender.iloc[0]}: {df.viscera.kurt():.4f}")
    
stats.shapiro(y)
```

#### SAS output 

![SAS Normality tests](figs/sas_abalone_normality_tests.png){#fig-sas-norm-001}

:::

Although the skewness seems large for the female group, the Normality tests 
do not reject the null hypothesis (see @fig-sas-norm-001).

### Paired Sample Test

The data in a paired sample test also arises from two groups, but the two groups 
are not independent. A very common scenario that gives rise to this test is when 
the same subject receives both treatments. His/her measurement under each treatment 
gives rise to a measurement in each group. However, the measurements are no longer 
independent.

::: {style="background-color: #D5D1D1; padding: 20px" #exm-paired-1}

### Reaction time of drivers

Consider a study on 32 drivers sampled from a driving school. Each driver is 
put in a simulation of a driving situation, where a target flashes red and  green
at random periods. Whenever the driver sees red, he/she has to press a brake button.

For each driver, the study is carried out twice - at one of the repetitions, the
individual carries on a phone conversation while at the other, the driver
listens to the radio.

Each measurement falls under one of two groups - "phone" or "radio", but the measurements
for driver $i$ are clearly related. Some people might just have a slower/faster baseline 
reaction time!

This is a situation where a paired sample test is appropriate, not an independent 
sample test.
:::

#### Formal Set-up

Suppose that we observe $X_1, \ldots , X_n$ independent observations from group
1 and $Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ independent observations from group 2. However the pair 
$(X_i, Y_i)$ are correlated. It is assumed that

\begin{eqnarray}
X_i &\sim& N(\mu_1,\, \sigma_1^2),\; i=1,\ldots,n \\
Y_j &\sim& N(\mu_2,\, \sigma_2^2),\; j=1,\ldots,n
\end{eqnarray}

We let $D_i = X_i - Y_i$ for $i=1, \ldots, n$. It follows that 
$$
D_i \sim N(\mu_1 - \mu_2,\; \sigma^2_1 + \sigma^2_2 - 2 cov(X_i, Y_i))
$$
The null and alternative hypotheses are stated in terms of the distribution of
$D_i$:

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0: & \mu_D = 0 \\
H_1: & \mu_D \ne 0
\end{eqnarray*}

The test statistic for this test is:

$$
T_2 = \frac{\bar{D} - 0 }{s / \sqrt{n} }
$$
where 
$$
s^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n (D_i - \bar{D})^2}{(n - 1)}
$$

Under $H-0$, the test statistic $T_2 \sim t_{n - 1}$. When we use a software
to apply the test above, it will typically also return a confidence interval,
computed as

$$
\bar{D} \pm t_{n - 1, 1 - \alpha/2} \times s / \sqrt{n}
$$

### Heart Rate Before/After Treadmill

The following dataset comes from the textbook [@rosner2015fundamentals], where 
an individual recorded his heart rate before using a treadmill (baseline) and 
5 minutes after use, for 12 days in 2006. 

::: {.panel-tabset}

#### R code 

To run the paired test, we use the same function `t.test` as earlier, but we set the 
argument `paired`.

```{r r-hr-1}
hr_df <- read.csv("data/health_promo_hr.csv")
before <- hr_df$baseline
after <- hr_df$after5
t.test(before, after, paired=TRUE)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-hr-1}
hr_df = pd.read_csv("data/health_promo_hr.csv")
#hr_df.head()

stats.ttest_rel(hr_df.baseline, hr_df.after5)
```

#### SAS Output

![SAS HR Paired t-test](figs/sas_hr_paired_ttest.png)


::: 

It is imperative to also make the checks for Normality. If you were to make
them, you would realise that the sample size is rather small - it is difficult
to make the case for Normality here.

A couple of interesting plots from SAS are these:

::: {layout-ncol=2}

![Paired Profiles](figs/sas_hr_paired_profiles.png)

![Agreement](figs/sas_hr_agreement.png)

:::

When we inspect the paired plot, we are looking for a similar gradient for each line,
or at least similar in sign. If instead, we observed a combination of positive 
and negative gradients, then we would be less confident that there is a difference 
in means between the groups.

For the agreement, if we were to observe a cloud of points centered around the
mean, with no clear trend to the points, then we would be more inclined to
believe that the mean difference is not 0.

:::

## Non-parametric Tests

If the distributional assumptions of the $t$-test are not met, we can take action 
in several ways. Historically, one method was to transform the data (if it was 
skewed) to make the histogram symmetric and thus closer to a Normal. But this was 
not ideal - it did not help in cases where the data was symmetric but had fatter 
tails than the Normal. As time progressed, statisticians invented tools to overcome
the distributional assumptions. One sub-field was robust statistics, which keep 
the assumptions to a minimum, e.g. only requiring the underlying distribution to be 
symmetric. Another sub-field was the area of non-parametric statistics, where 
almost **no** distributional assumptions are made about the data.

In this section, we cover the non-parametric analogues for independent and paired
2-sample tests.

### Independent Samples Test {#sec-indep-nonpar}

The non-parametric analogue of the independent 2-sample test is the Wilcoxon Rank
Sum (WRS) test (equivalent to the Mann-Whitney test). 

#### Formal Set-up

Suppose that we observe $X_1, \ldots , X_{n_1}$ independent observations from group
1 (with distribution $F$) and $Y_1, \ldots, Y_{n_2}$ independent observations from
group 2 (with distribution $G$). 

The hypotheses associated with this test are:

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0 &: & F = G \\
H_1 &: & F(x) = G(x - \Delta), \Delta \neq 0
\end{eqnarray*}

In other words, the alternative hypothesis is that the distribution of group 1
is a location shift of the distribution of group 2.

The WRS test begins by pooling the $n_1 + n_2$ data points and ranking them. The 
smallest observation is awarded rank 1, and the largest observation is awarded 
rank $n_1 + n_2$, assuming there are no tied values. If there are tied values, 
the observations with the same value receive an averaged rank.

Compute $R_1$, the sum of the ranks in group 1. If this sum is large, it means 
that most of the values in group 1 were larger than those in group 2. Note that 
the average rank in the combined sample is 
$$
\frac{n_1 + n_2 + 1}{2}
$$

Under $H_0$, the expected rank sum of group 1 is 
$$
E(R_1) = n_1 \times  \frac{n_1 + n_2 + 1}{2}
$$
Thus the test statistic is a comparison of $R_1$ with the above expected value:

$$
W_1 = \begin{cases}
\frac{\left|R_1 - \frac{n_1(n_1+n_2+1)}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{n_1n_2(n_1 + n_2 +1)/12}}, & R_1 \ne \frac{n_1 (n_1 + n_2 + 1)}{2} \text{ and no ties} \\
\frac{\left|R_1 - \frac{n_1(n_1+n_2+1)}{2} \right| - \frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{n_1n_2 \left( n_1 + n_2 +1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^g t_i (t_i^2-1)}{(n_1+n_2)(n_1+n_2-1)} \right) /12}}, & R_1 \ne \frac{n_1 (n_1 + n_2 + 1)}{2} \text{ and ties present} \\
0, & R_1 = \frac{n_1 (n_1 + n_2 + 1)}{2} 
\end{cases}
$$

The test above should only be used if both $n_1$ and $n_2$ are at least 10, and if 
the observations (not the ranks) come from an underlying continuous distribution. If these 
assumptions hold, then the test statistic $W_1$ follows a $N(0,1)$ distribution.

Just as in @sec-pair-nonpar, the $g$ refers to the number of groups with ties,
and $t_i$ refers to the number of tied values in each group.

WRS test.

:::

Since we know the number of observations in each group to be more than 10, the
approximation holds. Comparing to the @exm-abalone-1, observe that we have a
similar conclusion.

:::

{{< pagebreak >}}

### Paired Samples Test {#sec-pair-nonpar}

The analogue of the paired sample $t$-test is known as the Wilcoxon Sign Test 
(WST).

#### Formal Set-up

Again, suppose that we observe $X_1, \ldots , X_n$ observations from group 1 and
$Y_1, \ldots, Y_n$ observations from group 2. Groups 1 and 2 are paired (or
correlated) in some way.

Once again, we compute $D_i = X_i - Y_i$. The null hypothesis is that

\begin{eqnarray*}
H_0 &: & \text{median of $D_i$ is 0.} \\
H_1 &: & \text{median of $D_i$ is not 0.}
\end{eqnarray*}

We begin by ranking the $|D_i|$. Ignoring pairs for which $D_i = 0$, we rank the 
remaining observations from 1 for the pair with the smallest absolute value, 
up to $n$ for the pair with the largest absolute value (assuming no ties).

We then compute $R_1$, the sum of ranks for the positive $D_i$. If this sum is 
large, we expect that the pairs with $X_i > Y_i$ have a larger difference (in 
absolute values) than those with $X_i < Y_i$. Under $H_0$, it can be shown that 

$$
E(R_1) = m(m+1)/4
$$
where $m$ is the number of of non-zero differences.

Thus the test statistic is a comparison of $R_1$ with the above expected value:

$$
W_2 = \begin{cases}
\frac{\left|R_1 - \frac{n(n + 1)}{4} \right| - \frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{n (n+1)(2n + 1)/24}}, & R_1 \ne \frac{n(n + 1)}{4} \text{ and no ties} \\
\frac{\left|R_1 - \frac{n(n+1)}{4} \right| - \frac{1}{2}}{\sqrt{n (n+1)(2n+1)/(24 - 
\sum_{i=1}^g (t^3_i - t_i) / 48 )}}, & R_1 \ne \frac{n (n + 1)}{4} \text{ and ties present} \\
0, & R_1 = \frac{n (n + 1)}{4} 
\end{cases}
$$
where $g$ denotes the number of tied groups, and $t_i$ refers to the number of 
differences with the same absolute value in the $i$-th tied group.

If the number of non-zero $D_i$'s is at least 16, then the test statistic $W_2$ 
follows a $N(0,1)$ distribution approximately.

### Heart Rate Before/After Treadmill

#### R code

We can perform the Wilcoxon Signed Rank test in R:

```{r r-hr-5}
wilcox.test(before, after, paired = TRUE, exact = FALSE)
```

#### Python code

```{python py-hr-5}

```

#### SAS Output 

![SAS Signed Rank Test](figs/sas_hr_wilcox.png)

:::

In this problem, we do not have 16 non-zero $D_i$'s. Hence, we should in fact 
be using the "exact" version of the test (R and Python). However, the exact version 
of the test cannot be used when there are ties. 

In cases like this, we can turn to the bootstrap, or we can use a permutation test. We 
shall revisit these in our final topic.

## Summary

While the test statistics are shown in detail, we do not need the full details
for our class. I should also point out that the definitions of the test
statistic in @sec-indep-nonpar and @sec-pair-nonpar were both taken from
@rosner2015fundamentals. However, take note that different software have
slightly different implementations, for instance in how they deal with ties. As
always, my advice is to read the documentation as much as possible, and then 
to use the output of the tests as a guide to your decision-making (instead of the 
absolute truth).
