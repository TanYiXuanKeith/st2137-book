This folder contains the codes from the book chapters. Instead of
copying/pasting code from the main text, you can use the codes here.

Take note that I use a symbolic link to data/ directory one level up.

You can ignore the lines at the beginning of most R scripts, where I call reticulate
to load my virtual environment.
