This folder contains the codes from the book chapters. Instead of
copying/pasting code from the main text, you can use the codes here.

Take note that I use a symbolic link to data/ directory one level up.

The script utils.R can be used to extract the R and python codes into separate 
files. After that, I had to use quarto convert from the command line to convert 
the python scripts into python notebooks.

You can ignore the lines at the beginning of most R scripts, where I call reticulate
to load my virtual environment.
