# Preface {.unnumbered}

> One more robot learns to feel,

> Something more than a machine..

The lyrics above are from the song "One More Robot/Sympathy 3000-21", written by
The Flaming Lips in 2002. When I started preparing to teach this course in
mid-2023, AI had been around for a year or two already. I was stuck for a long
time wondering if this course is still relevant. 

Here's what I mean: The course is meant to introduce statistics majors (and
minors) to three computing languages: R, Python and SAS. But.. why does anyone
need to know this when we can just ask Gemini? More importantly, why does 
anyone need to know this when we *are* just going to ask Gemini?

I believe that's the key issue. We have a choice to use it or not. Work demands that 
we do things quickly, and the use of AI can cut down human errors. But the cost 
for this speed and convenience is paid by our humanity. To be human is to think, 
to solve problems, to have a purpose, and to make mistakes. An over-reliance on AI
will degrade these aspects indelibly.

I believe there is a need for data analysts to know how to code from scratch, if
only because of the value of the process. By coding from nought, and by digging
into data ourselves, we sharpen our minds. In "How to Solve It", Polya
recommends that, upon finding one solution to a problem, we ought to go back and
find ways to generalise the solution or to optimise it. Find opportunities in
this course to do so.

If you are taking this course, should you pretend that AI does not exist? If you
ask me, the only harm in doing so is to your grade. I believe there is great
value in struggling with a problem. That's what university was meant to be about
- to allow you to experiment, make mistakes and find your inclinations without
too much damage. However, if you really need help, don't hesitate to approach me
(first) or use AI. If you do use AI, I would hope that you take some time to
dissect it's solution to aid in more long-term understanding and recall.
